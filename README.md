# Small-Store 
Small-Store is small e-web web application, it's built using Spring Framework, and Spring MVC, I've applied many aspects that I've learned before such as
Spring MVC Architecture, Controller, View Resolver, Injection, JDBC Data Access with Spring, and Rest. in addition, I've applied such aspects of HTTP/HTTPS to improve the performance of the website.
